**Aaron John**

A wandering machine learning enthusiast, wanting to expand my horizons. This blog is about my long and exciting journey towards working on Artificial Intelligence(AI) and powering AI on devices. Hence, users can benefit from state of the art AI solutions for their daily problems truly anywhere, anytime.

This blog is inspired by [Andrej Karpathy’s](http://karpathy.github.io/) and [Chris Colah’s](http://colah.github.io/) blog. I will document the implementation of AI solutions relating to real world problems. In the documentation, I will also include source code repo's to my projects on github.
