In this project I made a Augmented Reality Ruler which relies on the built in sensors and A9 processor (Available through iPhone 6S and upwards.) The measurements are based on the plane detection's capabilities of ARKit. ARKit SceneKit View was used to obtain a view for the user screen.

Hereâ€™s how built the iOS app:

You can get my [AR Ruler iOS app work](https://github.com/aaronjohn2/FlowerRecog-master) on GitHub. In conclusion the AR Ruler works pretty well. It is not perfect in some situations, such as in low lighting or when a surface is not entirely flat. Hence, the results wont be completely accurate all the time and since ARkit is still in its Beta Phase you're better off using a real ruler for now, to measure anything requiring high accuracy.
