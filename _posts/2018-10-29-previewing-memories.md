Brief Description of app:
In this project we will have a tree of memories. This tree would store memory items, images and notes in augmented reality based on geo location. Imagine PokemonGO but memories posted in different locations by people with the intention of being public. Hence, any person who crosses the coordinates where the memory was posted would be able to see this in AR.

* This app allows you to take a picture, video or leave notes in any point of the world as long as one is connected to the internet.

* The main concept will be to be able to view other peoples memories in AR.
