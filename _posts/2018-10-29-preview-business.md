Brief Description of app:
In this project we will have a post of reviews and ratings in Augmented Reality(AR) at the front of each business location. This AR post would store images, ratings and notes in augmented reality based on the geo location of a business. Imagine Yelp in terms of AR. These AR posts are placed based on where the business is located. Hence, any person who crosses these coordinates will be able to see these posts in AR.

* This app allows you to take a picture, video or leave notes in front of any business(booth/building) as long as one is connected to the internet.

* The main concept will be to be able to view other peoples review posts in AR.
